# IMAGE-CRYPTOGRAPHY
Now a day the use of devices such as computer, mobile and many more other devices for communication as well as for data storage and transmission has increased. As a result, there is increase in number of users. Along with these users, there is also increase in number of unauthorized users which are trying to access a data by unfair means. This arises the problem of data security. Images are sent over an insecure transmission channel from different sources, some image data contains secret data, some images itself are highly confidential hence, securing them from any attack is essentially required. To solve this problem, we are using AES algorithm for encrypting and decrypting image. So,Image Cryptography is a project dealing with securing images over network. Therefore, no hacker including server administrators and others have access to original message or any type of transmittedinformation through public networks such as internet.
